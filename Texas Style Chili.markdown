Texas Style Chili
=================

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 ancho chiles
- 2 gaudillo chiles
- 2 new mexico chiles
- 2 tbsp. garlic
- 2 tbsp. cumin
- 2 tbsp. fennel seeds
- A few cloves
- One stick cinnamon
- 1 green pepper
- 1 onion
- 3 lbs. beef chuck
- 1/4 cup vinegar
- Beans (See Note)*

Notes
-----
- I grew up with beans in my chili and it was usually ground beef, a flavor package, and tomatoes--all things considered blasphemous in Texas. I'm still calling this Texas-Style Chili because I think the region should be credited with the two greatest advancements in chili technique--using real chiles and beef chunks. I associate these elements strongly with Texas Chili.
- Awesome scooped into flour tortillas with fresh onion, sour cream, and some cheese.

Process
-------

1. Cut up beef chuck into 1-2 in. cubes. Brown cubes with oil in stockpot. After browning meat chunks, deglaze with onions and green peppers and reduce to low heat and wait for slurry to be made.

2. At the same time, roast chiles until fragrant and simmer in stock for 20-30 minutes. Blend chiles and stock together with spices to create slurry, the consistency of a blended soup.

3. Pour slurry into meat and stir. Bring heat up and once boiling, reduce to bare simmer. Simmer about 2 hours.

4. Pour beans in and bring up to temp and simmer for another 20 minutes.
